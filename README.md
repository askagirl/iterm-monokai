## License

It's been a while since I first created/customized this theme, so I'm not 100% sure but I believe it was first based on [monokai.terminal](https://github.com/stephenway/monokai.terminal) by [@stephenway](https://github.com/stephenway).

Following in Stephen's footsteps, this has no license, feel free to use as you want.
